Despite having no sessions conducted (total sessions: 0), which explains the absence of reschedules and no-shows, the lack of any active students and the absence of any sessions suggest a significant disengagement or inability to commence tutoring. This scenario, combined with only 75% profile completion, points towards a high risk of churn or negative impact on students if not addressed."

This lack of engagement and activity could indicate a risk of future churn or negative impact on students if sessions were to occur."
