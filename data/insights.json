    "firstSessionFailures": [
      "Tutors with lower profile completion rates tend to have a significantly lower first session success rate (66.9% vs. 82.1%).",
      "High-risk tutors have a much lower average rating and first session success compared to low-risk tutors (1.95 vs. 4.14 and 16.6% vs. 92.4%).",
      "A large percentage of first sessions are unsuccessful due to tutor-initiated rescheduling, contributing to poor experiences."
    ],
    "commonRiskFactors": [
      "High reschedule rates among tutors correlate strongly with poor student experiences (12.8% for high-risk tutors).",
      "At-risk tutors often have lower profile completion rates, which may affect student trust and engagement.",
      "A small subset of tutors generates multiple support tickets, indicating potential reliability issues."
    ]
  },
  "systemRecommendations": [
    "Implement stricter profile completion requirements to ensure tutors present themselves effectively, aiming for a minimum of 80% completion.",
    "Develop a monitoring and support system for tutors with high reschedule rates, providing additional training or intervention as needed."
